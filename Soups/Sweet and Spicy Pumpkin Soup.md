# Sweet and Spicy Pumpkin Soup

## Ingredients
* 1 kg pumpkin
* 2 large red onions
* 2 carrots
* 3 stalks celery
* 2 large potatoes
* 2 red capsicum
* 2 to 3 of your favourite chiilies
* 1 tsp Hungarian sweet paprika
* 2 Tbs brown sugar
* 1 cup vegetable broth

## Steps
Wash and dice the pumpkin, skin on, setting the seeds aside.
Wash, de-seed and dice the capsicum and chillies.
Wash and dice all of the other vegetables and chillies.
Toss everything in the Instant Pot and cook on high pressure
for 5 minutes.

While that cooks, clean the pumpkin seeds, toss them with a bit of olive oil
and lay them out on parchment paper. Sprinkle lightly with salt and Hungarian
sweet paprika and slide them in the oven pre-warmed to 350°F/175ºC. Bake for
10 to 12 minutes or until beautifully browned. Watch them, they burn quickly.

When the Instant Pot is done release the pressure manually. Puree with a hand
mixer and pour. Sprinkle with Hungarian sweet paprika and garnish with roasted
pumpkin seeds. Serve.
