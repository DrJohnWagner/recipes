## Steps FIX ME!
Mix white and wholemeal flours and salt in a big bowl. Heat water until warm to the touch (about 110F or 43C), then add honey and brown sugar and stir thoroughly. Sprinkle yeast evenly on top and let sit for about 10 minutes, or until all of the yeast has settled to the bottom and a thick (ca. 1/2 inch or 1 cm) layer of foam has formed at the surface.

Take out about 1/2 cup of flour and dump it on your clean table, then pour the water and pureed tomatoes into the remaining flour. Add olive oil and stir, forming a ball of dough. Knead on the table for a full 20 minutes, using additional flour as needed when the dough becomes too sticky to knead.

After kneading use a dough roller to roll the dough into a flat sheet about 1/4 inch or 1/2 cm thick, then spread diced vegetable evenly on top and roll the dough up into a log. Knead the dough for another few minutes until the vegetales are evenly distributed throughout the dough, and then form the dough into a smotth ball. Clean your large bowl and then coat the inside with a thin layer of olive oil.

Take the upper rack out of the oven and warm the oven to about 115F or 45C. Place the dough inside the bowl, cover with parchment paper and set in the warmed oven. Place a cookie sheet in the bottom of the oven and pour 1 cup of boiling water into the cookie sheet. Close the oven and let the dough rise for about an hour until the volume has approximately doubled.

After first rise is done, dump the dough onto your table and knead for 5 minutes. Form the dough into a loaf shape and place in a bread pan that has been lightly greased with olive oil. Place back inside the warm oven and let rise for another hour until the dough has doubled again. The dough should now look like a perfectly formed loaf of bread.

Carefully pull out the cookie sheet, close the oven door and bake at 375F (190C) for about 25 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown. Remove the bread from the oven, let cool for a few minutes and then remove the bread from the bread pan and let cool on a rack for about 15 minutes.

Serve warm with butter and black currant and/or apple jam!
